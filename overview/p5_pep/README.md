# Python Enhancment Proposal - PEP
The development of python is managed by a series of documents called **PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposal)**

[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)

The very first PEPs you should be familiar with are  [PEP 20 -- The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)  and  [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

> **We are very strict regarding code-style and enforce it as part of CI!!!**

Nothing to run in this task â€“ just get yourself familiar with PEP8.
