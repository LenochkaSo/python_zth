# The python interactive interpreter is a *Read-Eval-Print-Loop* (REPL)

 1. **Read**: take user input.
 2. **Eval**: evaluate the input.
 3. **Print**: show the output to the user
 4. **Loop**: repeat
### Time for task:
From pycharm:
- open terminal
- invoke the interactive interpreter (simply run python)
- type some arithmetic operation
- define a function, call it and validate that its output is printed
- now call print("hello world") and check yourself - what is the difference from above step?
- in the REPL, the '_' variable has a special meaning - find out what?
- exit the interpreter - ctrl+z / quit() / exit()
