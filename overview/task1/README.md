# Python is a strongly-dynamically typed language!  
**Strongly typed** - every object has a definite type!  
  
**Dynamically typed** - there's no type checking of your code prior to running it.  
 - In a statically-typed language like C++ / Java - the compiler does a lot of type checking for you.  
 - In python you can also extend the program by adding new code, extend objects and definitions and modify the type system.
### Time for task
 - perform *task.py*
 - test yourself by running *test_task.py*

# Python is a compiled-interpreted language!
Which means your code is compiled prior to being interpreted.
