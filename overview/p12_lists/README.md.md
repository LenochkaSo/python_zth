# List
***Mutable*** sequences of objects
```python
>>> # empty list
>>> l = []

>>> # list of hetrogeneous items
>>> l = [1, "two", 3.0]
>>>
```
## List is a sequence, so...
```python
>>> # concatanation
>>> [1, 2] + [3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]

>>> # repetition
>>> [1, 2] * 2
[1, 2, 1, 2]

>>> # membership testing
>>> 3 in [1, 2, 4]
False

```
