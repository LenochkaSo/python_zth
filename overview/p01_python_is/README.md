# Python is a strongly-dynamically typed language!  
**Strongly typed** - every object has a definite type!  
  
**Dynamically typed** - object types are only resolved at runtime (no type checking of your code prior to running it).  
 - In a statically-typed language like C++ / Java - the compiler does a lot of type checking for you.  
 - In python you can also extend the program by adding new code, extend objects and definitions and modify the type system.
### Time for task:
 - perform ***task.py***
 - test yourself by running ***test_task.py***

# Python is a compiled-interpreted language!
Which means your code is compiled prior to being interpreted.

> **From now on Python == CPython**

> [CPython interpreter](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ceval.c) - search for main 'switch (opcode)'
### Time for task:
- observe ***task2.py***, run it and inspect its output
